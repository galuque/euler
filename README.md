# Project Euler

Tackling Project Euler problems in different programming lanuguages to better understand the tradeoffs and strengths of each one.

So far, thera are solutions in C, Python, Clojure and Haskell.

## Dependencies

`make` to run the commands to build and run the different scripts.

`gcc` for C

A Python 3.7+ interpreter

[Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) (and Java)

and [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
